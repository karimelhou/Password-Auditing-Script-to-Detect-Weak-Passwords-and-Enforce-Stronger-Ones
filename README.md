# Password-Auditing-Script-to-Detect-Weak-Passwords-and-Enforce-Stronger-Ones
Password Auditing Script: a script to check for weak passwords and enforce stronger ones.

This program checks for weak passwords and enforces stronger passwords if needed. It does this by checking the length, special characters, upper and lowercase letters, and numbers in the password that the user provides. If any of these conditions are not met, it will generate a random string of characters and append it to the user's password to create a stronger one.
